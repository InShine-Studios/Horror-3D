## 3. _Developers

This folder is used for **DEVELOPMENT** purposes. All local scenes and assets that you want to use during development should be kept here. Keep all new assets in your own subfolder under your name. After finishing your local development, move **ONLY** the assets that you want to integrate with the game to the corresponding folder.

> You can still push all local assets to GitHub since it should not conflict with any other assets. Integrating the new asset to the actual level can be done separately.

Example Cases:

**Ben wants to develop a new decoration "stove" prefab that can turn on and off.**

1. Create or copy an existing scene on your local folder "Ben/".
2. Create the prefab on your local folder "Ben/".
3. Create materials used for that prefab also in "Ben/". You can add your own directory "Ben/Stove".
4. Create a script called "StoveController" to turn the stove on and off.
5. Add flame particle assets for the stove.
6. Move all final assets to the corresponding folder. In this case it should be inside "Gameplay/Decorations" folder. Moved assets include M_HO_Stove, MAT_XXX, MAT_YYY, PS_Stove_Fire, etc.

> Add tests if needed.


**Sarah wants to add new audios for the "stove" Ben just finished working on.**

1. Copy Ben's stove scene.
2. Import the new audio to local folder "Sarah/".
3. Integrate the audio system with the "Stove" object in a new "Stove Prefab".
4. Add the "M_HO_Stove" mesh to the prefab.
5. Integrate the added audio through the script.
6. Move all final assets to the corresponding folder. In this case it should be inside "Audios" for the audio files and inside "Gameplay/Decorations" for the new prefab.

> Add tests if needed.


**Alex wants to integrate stove to a Map Scene**

1. Copy the Map Scene to local folder "Alex/".
2. Add Sarah's stove prefab (as needed). Remember to keep the scene hierarchy clean!
3. Check all functionality still runs the same.
4. Move the new scene to the original folder, add a suffix to the original name - e.g. "Asylum_Stoves".

> Tests should not be added for this.

Each script will be kept in its own subfolder depending on what it is used for. The name of the script file **must** be the same as the class name. All scripts should be named using **PascalCase** format.

<a name="test"></a>
### 4.7 Tests

The folder that will be used to run both **unit** (edit mode) and **integration** (play mode) tests. Each test class will be kept under a subfolder specific to the use of that test scenario.

## 5. Asset Naming Conventions

Naming conventions should be treated as law. A project that conforms to a naming convention is able to have its assets managed, searched, parsed, and maintained with incredible ease.

Most things are prefixed with the prefix generally being an acronym of the asset type followed by an underscore.

Naming Convention: `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix`

All assets should have a _Base Asset Name_. A Base Asset Name represents a logical grouping of related assets. Any asset that is part of this logical group
should follow the the standard of  `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix`.

Keeping the pattern `Prefix_BaseAssetName_Variant_Suffix` in mind and using common sense is generally enough to warrant good asset names.

<a name="anc-material"></a>
### 5.4 Materials

Assets that are **materials** that will be used in objects. Materials can both be the original material, material instance, or a physical material. Since materials can have variants for the same object, material names should specify both the part and variant of the material: **[Prefix]\_[ObjectName]\_[Part]\_[VariantNum]**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**


<a name="anc-mesh"></a>
### 5.5 Meshes

Assets that are **3D Original Meshes**. These original meshes will not have each variation for all materials that can be used for each mesh. Using a different Material can be implemented in a scene directly (less prefabs to be kept in the project).
Use **"M_"** as the prefix for meshes.

Examples:
- M_CH_Iris
- M_LS_CeilingLight_TMP

| Asset Type    | Prefix | Suffix | Notes |

| UI             | UI_         |        |       |

#### Character Sprites

For each character sprite, each frame must be named with this convention: **[CharName]\_[AnimActivity]\_[Direction]\_[OrderNum]**.
If there are no directions or number used (only one sprite) then empty the missing field.

Examples:
- Iris_Walk_W_1
- Iris_Idle_N
- RockMan_Idle_3

<a name="scene"></a>
## 6. Scene Structure

Next to the project's hierarchy, there's also scene hierarchy. This is only a  template example. You can adjust it to your needs. Scenes hould be kept only in _Developers folder or _Levels folder.

<pre>
Debug
Management
UI
Cameras
Lights
World
    Terrain
    Props
Gameplay
	Actors
	Items
_Dynamic
</pre>

 - All empty objects should be located at 0,0,0 with default rotation and scale.
 - For empty objects that are only containers for scripts, use "@" as prefix - e.g. @Cheats
 - When you're instantiating an object in runtime, make sure to put it in _Dynamic - do not pollute the root of your hierarchy or you will find it difficult to navigate through it.
